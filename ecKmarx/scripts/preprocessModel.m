% [model,name,version] = preprocessModel(model,name,version)
% Performs some preliminary modifications to the metabolic model & 
% retrieves the model's name & version (either by parsing model.id or by
% asking the user to input it), if they were not already defined.
%
% model     A genome-scale model in RAVEN format
% name      The name of the model (alternatively, an empty string)
% version   The version of the model (alternatively, an empty string)
% 
% model     The processed model
% name      The resulting name of the model (if not specified before)
% version   The resulting version of the model (if not specified before)
